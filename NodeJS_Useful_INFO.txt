__dirname -> path to current directory (console.log(__dirname) shows that if you want)

__filename -> file name

require -> function to use modules

module -> info about current module (file)

process -> info about the env where the program is being executed

Example of using setInterval():
            setInterval(() => {
	 	   console.log('Hello, world!')
		}, 1000); - the message is printed every second

Every file in nodeJs is a module

BUILT IN MODULES: (os, fs, path, http etc.)

npm init -y -> creates the package.json with default values for all the fields

nodemon -> whatches our files and restart the server everytime we make a change

!!Read about dependencies vs devDependencies in package.json (i think devDependencies
stands for the application development process only and in production, just the
dependencies are needed)
